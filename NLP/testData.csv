Xin Yu adds tremendously to the project so far because she is very organized and helps keep the group meetings on track and is good at delegating individual tasks to help meet deadline and push the project along. She helped divide up all the work in a way that was fair to everyone and keeps in contact almost daily regarding updates on the project and new things we need to get done. She is also very good at creating time for the group to meet and collaborate on things that require all of our attentions like the PDI and the engineering notebook.,Positive
Overall I've been really active in participating whenever my group is having discussions regarding the progress of our project. I contribute new ideas that could help us get a better grade and bring up possible early submission opportunities that will help our grades for the project. My understanding of all the project requirements for milestone one have helped us make sure that everything we need is included.,Positive
"Yasmin is really good at stopping during meetings to help any member who might be confused with their part of the project and breaking down points of confusion so we can continue working seamlessly together. she has a really good understanding of important components need for our submissions like Microsoft project and is willing to help other members who might not know it as well. She is also very good at using outside material to research and enhance our project. She reaches out to many different sources of information to make sure our project is always accurate. Overall, the group probably wouldn't have gotten as much done in the time frame that we have without her help.",Positive
Did a great job in brainstorming the company name and product name. Explained pretty well in the background information and project objective. Completed the full tasks.,Positive
"I did the 3D model for the design project and completed the slide of the Technical design description and the cost estimate in Milestone 1. I also went through the slides before submitting them, checking for any problems that might appear in the slide.",Positive
"Chelsea tends to do her work sometimes. I feel that sometimes communication can be a hassle because sometimes she takes a while to respond to things, which can be annoying at times. She also hasn't done much work in her role, which might be fine for now (as we are still figuring out the circuitry layout for the headphone and where to pit things at), but I feel like she could be more responsive and take on more work.",Negative
I am always willing to put in the time and effort. I finish all my parts on time and try to do as much as I can whenever I have spare time during the week.,Positive
Kazi is always up to date with tasks and is fully aware of what the deadlines for the project are. He is very organized and communicates very effectively.,Positive
"Briana is very helpful and always does her part. Whenever we are all working together, she makes sure that we are on track and completing the assignment we are meant to be completing.",Positive
Yurika is always thinking of ways of how to proceed with the project. She mentions what she part of the project she wants to be able to accomplish in a certain time period. She is also always thinking of ways to improve our project and its design.,Positive
"I feel like I am the only one managing the team deadlines and what needs to be done, which I don't like. I'm also the head for the technical aspects for our design and I feel like I don't have a sufficient skillset and knowledge base to execute the project succcessfully alone in that aspect.",Negative
I think I have been efficient and active on doing the project. I finished my part of work quickly for the early due of Benchmark A. I communicate with the team member every week to discuss the next step to do. But I think I am not good at using Revit 2022 enough. I still need to learn to master this software since it is important for finishing the project.,Neutral
Carl is always efficient at finishing his work. He's never late for meetings and discussions about the SLDP project. He is familiar with using Revit to do our project. Carl communicates with me frequently about how the project is going. Carl is a very good partner.,Positive
"Great work in terms of teamwork, staying on task, and making sure everything is done and everyone is on task.",Positive
Consistently meets the expectations of the assignment. Listens to everyone. Writes checklists that keep the team focused. Records team progress and tasks remaining. Questions things to ensure that processes are the best they can be.,Positive
Completes the required coding-related assignments due to having a computer science principles. Sets goals and checkpoints to help the team. Ensures that things get done by asking if each member understands the tasks that they need to accomplish. Listens to everyone's opinions. Checks work to ensure it is generally correct.,Positive
Actively listens to others' opinions and ideas of how things should be done. Invests time to ensure the team is doing the job well. Questions things to ensure that processes are the best they can be. Helps the team think of issues that have been overlooked.,Positive
"John has kept track of our schedule on Microsoft Project, and he has been working with Milestone 2 objectives as well. John helps encourage the team and has contributed to all parts of the project so far.",Positive
"Kazi has kept track of our budget, and he has been keeping a list of parts that we need. Kazi contributed to all parts of the project so far. He is excellent at communicating and staying on track as well.",Positive
Briana has taken a lot of initiative with the design process. She has stayed on top of creating the CAD models as well as working with the Milestone 2 requirements. Briana has contributed to all parts of the project so far.,Positive
"I try my best to ensure that we know what tasks we have to complete each week. My recent contributions included finding parts, doing research, completing the code flowchart, helping with the Milestone 2 presentation, discussing how to build the prototype, and helping with design.",Positive
"Despite not being available during the weekend, he makes it up by going to the open lab and working on his part in completing the design. He is a true team leader by keeping the team optimistic and encouraging us to stay on task. He is well-rounded, often switching roles from designing to note-keeping and making our presentations.",Positive
"I haven't been engaged with the team, usually just agreeing with their idea. However, I always try to make myself useful in any area they want me to. I always make sure to respond to their text messages that are related to the project. For the most I'm well aware of what we are doing; I need to communicate and engage more with the team.",Neutral
"Greyden has been an instrumental member of the team. He keeps us on track by setting mini-goals daily to ensure we have all the components for a specific due date. He always engages with the team by providing that we are all in agreement and reminding us to fill out the engineering journal. Despite his workload, he manages to clear up his schedule to attend the meetings. He is also well rounded, mainly dedicated to design.",Positive
"I am the head of design for this team, and I designed both the logo and the structure on Fusion 360. I did a fair share of work on the presentations and the PDI.",Positive
"Hanming is the head of software. He is in control of all the code, so Luis and I don't have to worry about coding. He contributes a lot to the team.",Positive
Luis is the head of production. He might not have the necessary skills coming into this project but he is trying to learn from either us or the TAs.,Positive
"Done an exceptional job of keeping team motivated and performing delegated work responsibly, efficiently, and to a high quality.",Positive
Completes work on time and to a high quality. Provides constructive feedback and makes himself an asset to the team.,Positive
"I have accomplished all my work efficiently and on time, and see to it that the team meets our deadlines ahead of time and to a high standard of quality.",Positive
Leo works hard in achieving his own tasks as well as helping team tasks. He applies his skills in CAD to help the team in the areas where we are less experienced. He communicates well and completes his work in time.,Positive
"I believe I have been responsible in both completing my own tasks and encouraging my teammates to work hard by reminding them of early submissions and deadlines. I have a background in a few of the skills needed for this project, so I've been able to help my teammates where I could, and also handling my own portion of the project, the coding parts. I sometimes might not be the best communicator, and might come off too strongly, which is something that I could watch for in the future and develop.",Positive
Leo has been great. He was the one who came up with the idea of the project. He has put a lot of effort into the project. He has a clear picture of how to create it and its purpose. He makes sure both me and Hanming have a clear vision of the project and how it will work. His explanations of his vision of the project are thorough and concise. He has made sure that he includes both me and Hanming in the project. When either of us bring a suggestions he makes a compromise and ensures we contribute. He also actively will ask us for our inputs so we are included. His work of designing is of high quality. He asks his teammates to review his work in case any helpful suggestions can be made to improve his quality. He makes sure he does his a fair share of work. Possible criticisms are as follows. He also should make it clear to his teammates what he needs to be done so he can complete his job effectively. He should set deadlines so his teammates have a clear plan of what to do by what date. When Hanming expressed concern over the state of the project he agreed with him. The issue is he didn't provide any useful input. He should have expressed concern over the state of the project and followed up that concern with a problem solving attitude and discussion of how to get the project back on track. Saying you dont think the project will be done and leaving it at that is not helpful. It's negative and negatively impacts the attitude of the team. It is frustrating to hear your teammates say the don't think the project will be done and not offer ways to address the problem.,Neutral
"Hanming has been great. He is much more knowledgeable in matters of electronics or coding than I am. I am in charge of wiring and assembly of the project. Despite this, Hanming has been very helpful and has been the one to suggest possible ways of wiring and assembling the project. He also has verbalized that he is willing to help me if I have any difficulties. He has been respectful during all interactions. He has contributed his fare share of the project. He also goes out of his way to review my work and give suggestions to improve it. He produces high quality work. Possible criticisms are as follows. He previously expressed a negative concern that the project would not be finished in time. But he didn't do it in a productive way. He should have taken initiative and spoken with a positive problem solving attitude as opposed to communicating negatively. Saying the project isn't going to be finished puts everyone in a negative mood. As a result, Leo agreed with him and also said a non productive negative statement that further hurts the attitude of the group. He should have expressed concern over the state of the progress and then follow up his concern with a productive statement like ""What can we do to get back on track to finish guys?"". Another criticisms that is that he should express what he needs in order to do his part of the project. This is a group project where labor is being divided. Hanming might need me to do something before he can do his job. He should express explicitly what he needs from each member to do his job effectively. Especially if he feels as if the project isn't going to get done. This specific criticism applies to everyone on the team including myself.",Neutral
"I have been doing a great job on the project. I have been able to effectively coordinate with my team. I have been able to communicate with them efficiently as well. I have been respectful and mindful of my actions. I have made efforts to make sure they feel like they are being heard and not overshadowed. When it comes to my contribution, I have done great. I have made sure to due my fair share of work. I have done my share of work in a timely matter and made sure to leave time to review and check my work with my teammates. I also make myself available to my teammates in case they require assistance with work. Even if the aforementioned work is not mine. When it comes to keeping on track, I make sure when I am with my teammates I establish goals for all of us to do. This way everyone has a sense direction as to what they should do. When it comes to quality, I make sure to review my teammates work and provide suggestions regarding how to better their work. I ask them to give me suggestions on how to better my work. When it comes to knowledge and skills, I am not very knowledgeable. I specifically dedicated myself to aspects of the projects that I am capable in. If Hanming, for example, needed help with coding I would not be able to provide it. I would be disposable to learn and attempt to aid but I am not capable. If Leo were to need help in designing, I would be disposable to. However, I am not capable in that regard so I would provide limited aid. Some things I could be better at are as follows. I need to improve my skills in coding and designing so I can be more helpful to my teammates. I also need to improve my skills in wiring so I don't end up relying too much on my teammates. I also need to get better at problem solving. Since I am head of wiring and assembly, I need to communicate more effectively to my teammates the things I need. I also need to provide my teammates with deadlines so that I can do my job effectively. I feel as if I am contributing the least to the project and will make efforts to correct that.",Positive
Friendly and always willing to help when others have issues. On-time to meetings.,Positive
"I would like to bring more to the table for my group, but I am not sure how. I also think I need to spend more time researching on my own to improve my skills.",Neutral
"Chris is a great teammate and very fun and easy to work with. We get along great and there are no issues in the team chemistry. Chris does have a problem showing up for the RAD mentor meetings, but he is cognizant of that and has made a commitment to be better at showing up. It currently feels like I shoulder most of the planning aspect, but I think if Chris starts coming to the meetings this burden will be shared more equally. This stage is mostly coding which is Chris' area of expertise so he is completing more of the tasks. I am mainly focused on auxiliary tasks like the logo, CAD, and maker space training so we can get the physical product done as quickly as possible. All in all, I love working with Chris, when we can work together. It is starting to get frustrating that he does not show up for the meetings, but outside of that I can't complain at all. He always does high-quality work very quickly and is able to draw on a vast wealth of knowledge in microprocessors and prototyping to speed up the coding process. I just really hope he holds to his commitment to show up to the RAD meetings",Positive
I love working with my team and I hope we can help each other grow as both engineers and active members of a team throughout this semester.,Positive
"Aside from the comments left in the previous box meant for the instructor, I don't have much else to say. I am very satisfied with my teammates, and I look forward to the progress of our project.",Positive
"Aimee did Logo design and code flow chart for our group so far. At the same time, she contributed a lot of ideas to our design and always are willing to help. She is good at using Adobe illustrator and her iPad to draw our logos. She always replied messages of teammates quickly. Her design of our Logo is perfect and fits our project's purpose and appearance so well. She always has a delicate work with high quality. Furthermore, she communicates efficiently with group mates or TAs when facing problems. High quality work need a lot of effort to be put in, so Aimee needs time to finish them. However, she still finished them on time, which is impressive.",Positive
"Sunny is a helpful and knowledgable person with impressive skills on computer programming and electronic stuff. He did the circuit diagram of our design perfectly. He also refined our CAD model design to make it looks nicer, which fulfills users' needs. He is very friendly as well. He is wiling to communicate with group mates and always respects everyone's opinion. He always did the difficult part during our project with high quality. However, he should take more sleep and rest.",Positive
"I did most of the writing like PDI and presentation stuff on time with good quality. Also, I came up with some designing ideas, like brainstorming the functions of our autoscrub. I also drew an initial CAD design of our project. Information and announcements were actively shared with my group mates. I replied the messages from my group mates on time. To help our project more, I can engage more in the project's construction, like wiring circuits or 3D printing some parts of our autoscrub.",Positive
Karl is enthusiatic and is a postive teamate to have in the group. He shows signs of above average skills using CAD (better than me). I wish he would be more aware of our meetings and deadlines. It is best to communicate and read our texts so there isnt any further porblems with miscommunication.,Neutral
"Lili has done a very good job being on top of and managing tasks. She has almost took it upon herself to take a leadership role. She works on things and assigns tasks before it is too late. The only critism I would have is that she should try to stay more composed and stress out less as it can be detrimental to the quality of our work. Then again, this comes with good time management and orginisation as a group.",Positive
"I feel that I am a reliable and pleasant team member to work along side. I suggest ideas, I am open to changes and I am wiolling to work on something that was originally considered ""my task"". I will say my weakness is most likely time management as, while I am on top of things and aware of when they should be done, I procrastinate.",Positive
"Alex, you did a great job",Positive
"Personally, I believe rating oneself is always full of bias, so take my words with a grain of salt, but I coordinated many of group's activites, including planning the milestone 1 presentation. I solely worked on creating the team schedule, which I later communicated and approved with my team, designed the CAD model, and finished the logo design as well. Overall, I was a valuable member to the team.",Positive
"Amanda as always, you did a great job pulling the team together as team leader and making sure everyone had a role in the team, knowing what they wanted to. You likewise",Positive
"Although you were absent from meetings and hard to contact at times, Tony you do really tremendous work, and your ability to pull through and learn how to do the objectives, whether it is coding or circuitry, is incredible. I wish you communicated a little more but anyways, you are awesome!",Positive
A good leader and insturctor.,Positive
A good organizer and writer.,Positive
I need more reinforcement and practice on coding to better help the group.,Neutral
"Alex did a great job on showing up on meetings, providing insightful opinions and support the team with passion. He contributed in the Preliminary Design Investment with efforts. Alex uses inclusive and respectful languages throughout the discussion. In future teamwork, I wish Alex to maintain his behavior and learn a bit of coding in advance to be even more contributive.",Positive
"I came to every meeting with Alex, and kept track on the schedules and deadlines. During the weekend I spent some spare time on making and coding the robot, and helped to check out early for benchmark A. I monitored myself to use inclusive language and respect each other. I'll put more efforts on CAD drawings to take some responsibilities off from Alex.",Positive
You always get the work done and the schedule you made has been helpful. I feel that you could be a little bit more interactive with the team so that we are all on the same page.,Neutral
Good work. You knowledge of coding and circuits is amazing to me and I hope to learn from you.,Positive
Your ability to keep us on track is crucial for the teams success. You always make sure things are being done and are ready to follow up on task that I would have otherwise forgotten about.,Positive
I feel like I could be learning more things but school has been taking up a lot of time. I learned how to do CAD and although I am proud of that I wish I could have been more active when making the circuits virtually.,Neutral
Does good work but try to come to all meetings and help more with tasks.,Positive
I do all necessary tasks before the due date but need to get better at researching for my project.,Neutral
Helps with the tasks and give good ideas on how we can improve our project.,Positive
"Alex contributes to the group meeting and had good questions regarding design ideas. Also, all of the things he presented in the presentation was decent, and he generally finished his tasks on time.",Positive
"Amanda is usually ahead of the schedule and encourages us to do things as early as possible. She leads us to appoint the date of meeting with the TA. Also, she could finish tasks on time and contributes to the group brainstorming.",Positive
"Good overall performance. The works are all completed and had a decent presentation of the background information. However, more details regarding the intention of the tea machine could be discussed. Also, the talking can be more in a group meeting",Neutral
Desmond is the team leader and is enthusiastic in developing the ideas and design of the project. He appoints us with equally divided tasks and communicates closely with us regarding the ideas of the RAD project. He also did a lot work on the presentation and could be able to make final decisions on ideas,Positive
Take the time to read the HIR manual in its entirety because it answers a lot of the questions you're asking at times.,Negative
I think I need to get better at managing my time properly for my assigned tasks. I find myself spending too long on them sometimes. I think I also need to be more proactive about reaching out to my teammates.,Neutral
"Consistently completes tasks on time and to a high standard. Is almost always in communication and updates the team regularly about progress. Has not shown up in-person for RAD mentor meetings, but is able to catch up and execute the tasks established there. Has very detailed knowledge and experience in his assigned area. Easy to work with and creates a casual, non-confrontational environment in team meetings.",Positive
"I consistently complete work on time. I have a good amount of knowledge in my area, but I sometimes take extra time to complete my tasks compared to Chris. I reliably show up to RAD mentor meetings and team meetings. I help coordinate the group and make sure we are on track to meet deadlines. I rarely have to help Chris with his tasks, but both of us know what the other is doing in case one of us needs to take up slack for the other.",Neutral
"Your attentiveness to detail in addition to your proficiency in electrical design is very helpful to the team. I feel that you could work on being more communicative of your progression to the group outside of our scheduled meetings, but so could the rest of us. Overall, you go above and beyond, especially as it pertains tot he PDI, and offer valuable skills to the team.",Positive
"I execute quality work and offer my support to my teammates whenever they need it. While I am aware that my technical skills as well as my design skills are not as proficient as those of my teammates, I carry-out each task to the best of my ability, asking for help when necessary. I do, however, understand that I need to be more consistent when it comes to completing the tasks in a timely manner as well as communicating with my teammates outside of our weekly schedule meetings.",Positive
"Completes tasks as they are received. Dedication to project shows through willingness to research and implementation of knowledge gained from research into the actual code for the project. Sometimes, decisions are made without first communicating with the group, so I think you could work on communication, although that is an area of improvement for all team members.",Positive
I know that you have been feeling under the weather and so am I but we gotta make it up to rose and take on some more work i feel bad,Neutral
"I have mainly contributed to the group by voluntarily creating a CAD model alone, and I am planning to create the team logo with CAD as well before the due date. I have contributed less than my team mates in the power points slides, and have been feeling under the weather. However, I will make up for my slack by communicating on what needs to be done, and collaborating with my teammates to progress in our project.",Neutral
"Is punctual and ready to meet. Helped out greatly with the design and code. Does contribute to PDI, engineering notebook, slides, etc. Good at listening to ideas.",Positive
"Is punctual and helped out with the PDI, engineering notebook, and presentation slides. Would like to see more help with the code.",Neutral
It was a bit difficult to design and think about building a robot without any guidance except the student manual but it allowed me to gain experience about electronics and design. I stayed on top of tasks and successfully programmed the robot to achieve the milestone 2 benchmark.,Positive
Rose is very organized and she led point on making the project schedule. Her organizational skills are very strong and I believe the group will be able to manage our time wisely as Rose created a manageable schedule for us all. I don't have any constructive comments as of right now.,Positive
"I believe that while my performance so far has been efficient, I can definitely improve in any aspect. I'm not sure I will know which aspects until we encounter a complicated situation during our project in which case, I will do my best to navigate the complexity and provide amazing work/results.",Neutral
George has been extremely efficient in designing the team logo and in designing the CAD model for our project. He is well versed in his knowledge of utilizing the software to provide excellent results. I don't have any constructive comments as of right now.,Positive
